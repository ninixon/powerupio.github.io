It has been listed on eBay before for $500,000, but its value is unknown because it has never been sold. The developer later re-released 100 new copies on eBay.

The only one which was complete with the box sold for $31,600. The cartridge by itself has sold for up to $3,575. When dealing with games this rare, having the box can increase the value by tens of thousands of dollars.

It wasn&rsquo;t a very big success, so very few were sold to customers. Two people claim to have the game, but only one has confirmed it.

                Nintendo World Championships
            </div>It is known as the “Holy Grail” of video games. In 1990 Nintendo held a gaming competition in Los Angeles, California. Players would compete for the combined high score in 3 specially timed challenged games: Super Mario Bros., Rad Racer, and Tetris. 116 NWC cartridges were made and given to finalists at the end of the competition, 90 of these being Grey instead of Gold. Of the 26 Gold cartridges only 13 have surfaced. A lot of credit goes to Jason Wilson, who, in the late 90’s, managed to track down and buy from finalists 7 of these golden cartridges before they were ever sought after and then sold them to collectors. If you can find one, they now go for $20,000 and up.

            </div>They Gray version, while not as valuable, is still one of the most sought after cartridges. Due to the unique number given to each of the carts that go beyond 90, many people believe there were more manufactured. Heather Martin, one of the competition finalist, eventually sold her copy for $8,000 on eBay.

Nintendo pulled it from shelves in order to remake it as “World Class Track Meet”. Only 2,000 copies were believed to have been purchased by retailers and only 200 were sold to customers. The remaining were recalled and destroyed. Of the ones that sold, only around 20 have been known to surface and only 2 remain sealed in the package. The owner of the online retailer, JJ Games, purchased one of these sealed games for $41,300. An opened, boxed version sold for $13,000 on eBay.

Players would compete for the combined high score of 3 timed challenged mini-games in Super Mario Bros. 3, PinBot, and Dr. Mario. Only a single copy of this game is known to exist since most are believed to have been destroyed after the competition was over. In 2006, a video game collector named Rob Walters found the game in a Nintendo employee’s garage sale in New York. It has since sold for $20,000 and now belongs to Jason Wilson, who has the biggest video game collection in the world.

They were never released, but were discovered in 1997 in a warehouse and sold to the public. Even though it is known as one of the worst games ever made, a complete in boxed version can be worth around $800, and a sealed one up to $1,500+, depending on the condition.

Many thought they were bootlegs of the real game. As more surfaced, it was found that they were test cartridges used with the Nintendo Service Centers. The gameplay is still the same as the original Zelda cartridge. It is unknown how many actually exist and they can sell for $500 and up on eBay.

                DK Competition
            </div>The game was used in the Powerfest ’94 championship finals, as well as the Blockbuster World Video game Championships II in 1995 as a qualifier. It is a special timed version of the original Donkey Kong Country. You have five minutes to collect as many points as possible. After the competition ended, the carts were sold through Nintendo’s Super Power Supplies Catalog. According to the box, only 2,500 copies were made. They sell between $500 and $1200.

            </div>Used by Blockbuster Video in tournaments held within the store. It featured time-limited single player mode on modified stages, as well as an exclusive bonus level. Players in the competition could win a t-shirt, a jacket, or a trip to international destinations depending on how well they scored. After the competition ended some of these special edition games were sold in the store. Nintendo Power also offered the remaining carts through their catalog. You can find them for around $400.

                Chrono Trigger
            </div>Released in 1995, it is one of the most popular role-playing games for the Super Nintendo and is highly sought after by fans. Its success has led to having a port to PlayStation 1 and Nintendo DS. Loose carts often sell for $120, but complete with the box can go for more than $300. Since this game is more popular than other RPG’s on the console, a sealed version can go into the $5,000 range.

                Sonic The Hedgehog (US)
            </div>The US version of the game is a lot rarer than the PAL version. Since the Master System was more of a success in Europe, Sega imported PAL versions of the game into the US. The only thing that set this game apart is the UPC barcode sticker on the back of the box, which begins with 01008 instead of 49743. Because of this small change it has known to be easily faked. It has sold for up to $1,000 on eBay. Check the back of your case, you might be surprised with what you find.

Winners were given a year’s worth of free game rentals from the store and all players were given trading cards. It was said to have been destroyed after the event ended under company orders. There are only 2 known copies that have been found and one has sold for $2,000.

            </div>The game was a piano teaching tool created in 1990 by The Software Toolworks, which came with a MIDI keyboard. The user could learn hundreds of lessons by following music notes on the screen and the keyboard could also be used separate from the game. It can be found for around the same price as its original retail cost of around $500. It was released for multiple consoles, such as NES and PC, but the Genesis version seems to be the hardest to find.

It was never made for sale because of legal battles with Nintendo, who eventually gained the copyright. Only 10 copies are known to still be out there. One copy was purchased in 2008 for $14,600 and the owner was then able to get it signed by the creator, Alexey Pajitnov.
